Consist readme
--------------

The package has the following dependencies:
 - g2o (with Cholmod support)
 - Cholmod + BLAS
 - Eigen3
 - Qt4 (optional)
 - QGLViewer (optional)
 - OpenGL (optional)
 - Doxygen (optional)

Qt4, QGLViewer and OpenGL are required only if you want gui support for the
tester application. If all of the three are found, gui support will be
automatically enabled.
Doxygen is required only if you want to build the documentation. 

Compile with:
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make

You can build the documentation with:
$ make doc

Note that currently there is no install functionality built in, sorry.

The library is bundled with two applications, refer to the documentation
for the usage instructions, or run the applications with the --help flag.
